## Description

This is An Account Abstraction wallet portal, users can connect their wallet and upgrade it into an Account Abstraction wallet. For this hackathon, we focused on gas-free and off-chain payment implementation with Account Abstraction because we believe that removes so many users' obstacles to joining the crypto space.

Also, we implemented social recovery in the contract.

Then we explained we can use this wallet app as a web3 shortcut with batch tx and automated tx, this is a future implementation task for us. The business model is fee from the off-chain payment and also we look for the opportunity to get grants from L2.

More detail and technical diagram can be found on GitHub.
